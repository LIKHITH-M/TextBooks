## Security framework core components

1. Identify & document security goals
2. Setting guidelines to achieve security goals
3. Implementing strong security processes
4. Monitoring & communicating results

## CIA triad (foundational model)

- Confidentiality (info is private)
- Integrity (info is correct)
- Availability (info is available)

- Asset: Item perceived as having value to an organisation.
- Value: Cost associated with the asset in question(?).

## Cybersecurity Framework AKA NIST CSF

- Voluntary framework with standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk.

There is also the Risk Management Framework (NIST RMF), FERC-NERC, FedRAMP, CIS, GDPR, PCI DSS, HIPAA, ISO SOC, etc!

## Ethical principles

All 3 essentially boil down to "don't bypass controls just because you can". So no sharing info, no tipping off friends, etc.

1. Confidentiality
2. Privacy protections
3. The law

## Counterattacks

- U.S. doesn't permit them, sees them as vigilantism.
- International Court of Justice allows them (but of course most orgs v rarely do) if:
  - The counterattack will only affect the party that attacked first.
  - The counterattack is a direct communication asking the initial attacker to stop.
  - The counterattack does not escalate the situation.
  - The counterattack effects can be reversed.
