## Feedback

Good that videos can be fast-forwarded, and the transcript has highlights. Lets you drastically speed up learning.

Definitely focused more on the industry than any actual learning. For example, individual's stories, what a security analyst does, skills needs, etc. However, it is a well-rounded introduction.

Nice animations / graphics / video editing etc. All feels high quality.

The 30-minute reading estimations are ridiculous, 5 minutes max.

1.1 took perhaps an hour, would take twice as long with no background knowledge.
