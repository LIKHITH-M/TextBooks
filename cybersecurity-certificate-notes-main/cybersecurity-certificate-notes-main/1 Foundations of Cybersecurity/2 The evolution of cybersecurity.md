## Feedback

Nice focus on examples now we're more "into the meat". Example is briefly described, then the relevant topic introduced. Nice!

Quizzes during videos help stay engaged, and being able to click transcript to load that part is great.

Different types of activity (reading, video, quiz, flashcards) keep it fresh.
