## SIEM tools

SIEM tools = security information and event management tools. E.g.:

- Splunk
- Google's Chronicle
- Presumably also things like Embrace etc (when using more inputs)

## Playbooks

2 common examples on forensic cases:

1. **Chain of custody**: Similar to IRL police, documenting who/what/where/why evidence is collected, who is responsible, tracking it, etc.
2. **Protecting and preserving evidence**: Need to know what is fragile / volatile. Something called the "order of volatility" exists, essentially just save the volatile stuff (e.g. RAM) first, whereas HDDs are stable.

## Feedback

The variety keeps it interesting, even when most of the information isn't new. For example, whilst I know the basics of Linux, having it explained in 1-2 sentences and applied specifically to something I'm interested in (cybersecurity, examining logs) makes it relevant.

However, the portfolio activity was... weird. Sure, the information was helpful and up to date, but do I _need_ a professional statement? I guess it makes sense since this course is targeted to job-seekers, but having it self-graded makes it feel a bit pointless. Especially if I already have a job! It also doesn't consider different countries preferring different formats, and describes the very US-centric format.

Again, timing is very inflated. 45 minutes for a 9 question multiple choice quiz?

- Interestingly, it cites "14 hours approximately". More like ~4, but perhaps had tabs open for a long time.
