## Security controls

Safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks

Types:

- Technical: Tech used to protect assets, e.g. encryption.
- Operational: E.g. awareness training.
- Managerial: E.g. policies, standards, procedures.

## Data related roles

- Data owner: Person who can access / edit / use / destroy their info.
- Data custodian: Anyone (or anything, e.g. system) responsible for safe handling / transport / storage of information.
- Data steward: Person / group that maintains data governance policies

## Types of accounts

User accounts can often be grouped into:

- Guest accounts: External users, v limited access.
- User accounts: Employees.
- Service accounts: For software that needs to interact with other software.
- Privileged accounts: Admins.

## Data lifecycle

Collect, Store, Use, Archive, Destroy

## Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)

An encryption framework that secures the exchange of information online.

1. Exchange of encrypted information
   - Asymmetric: Public key widely shared, private key only accessed by owner. Public key encrypts, private key decrypts. Examples are RSA or DSA.
   - Symmetric: Single secret key to exchange information. Examples are 3DES or AES.
2. Establish trust using system of digital certificates between computers and networks

## Hashing

- Non-repudiation: Authenticity of information can't be denied

## Access controls

Manage authentication, authorization, and accountability of information (AAA framework).

- Authentication: "Who are you?"
  1. Knowledge: Something known.
  2. Ownership: Something possessed.
  3. Characteristic: Something user is.
- Authorization: "What can you do?"
  - Separation of duties: Users should not be given perms to influence themselves.
  - Principle of least privilege
- Accounting: "What happened?"

## Types of access control

- MAC (Mandatory access control): Chain of command had to agree to everything, used in military / gov.
- DAC (Discretionary access control): Data owner decides access (e.g. google doc perms).
- RBAC (Role-based access control): Authorization controlled by roles.

## Feedback

There's so much effort put into the animations and created videos! It undeniably helps create a high quality, engaging experience.

It's good that during the labs, commands are copyable. Typing would be pointless busywork.
