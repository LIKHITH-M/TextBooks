# Cybersecurity notes

Miscellaneous notes made during study for [Google's Cybersecurity Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/google-certificates/cybersecurity-certificate).

This took ~3 weeks of occasional study, with certificates for each "Course", and [the overall certificate](https://coursera.org/verify/professional-cert/GLBE227BHPQ9).

## Notes on notes

1. I typically only note things that I suspect I'll forget, or that don't make sense immediately. As such, my notes are only a small subset of the course's full content.
2. Each folder is a course, containing a `.md` per "module". E.g. my notes on Course 1 Module 1 [are here](/1%20Foundations%20of%20Cybersecurity/1%20Welcome%20to%20the%20exciting%20world%20of%20cybersecurity.md).
3. Finally, there's informal feedback throughout, these are reminders to myself for an article!
