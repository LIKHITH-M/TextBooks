## Common operating systems

- Windows: Introduced 1985, closed source.
- macOS: Introduced 1984, partially open source.
- Linux: Introduced 1991, fully open source.
- ChromeOS: Introduced 2011, partially open source, derived from:
  - Chromium OS: Fully open source.
- Android: Introduced 2008, fully open source.

## How OS works

- Turn on machine, BIOS or UEFI chip activated, loads a bootloader, then that loads the operating system.
  - BIOS: Basic Input/Output System
  - UEFI: Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (introduced 2007, more security)

## Virtualization

- Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) is an open source hypervisor built into Linux kernel.
- Can also have virtual servers, virtual networks, etc.

## Feedback

An odd conflict between the absolute basics "what does an OS do" and more advanced "here's how VM virtualization works"! Also needed to play all content at 1.5x.
